        <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
        <p><strong>By Evan Wild</strong></p>

        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures,
          self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from
          renowned documentary, <em>The Jungle Book</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision?
          In this article we try to answer those questions and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>

        <h3>Types of bear</h3>

        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear,
          then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home
          in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behaviour however,
          as you'll find out below.
        </p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Bear Type</th>

              <td>Fish, meat, plants</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Urban</td>
              <td>North Face</td>
              <td>18 to 22</td>
              <td>Condos and coffee shops</td>
              <td>20 to 32 years</td>
              <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients.
          In general, they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down
          sustenance from farms or country houses.
        </p>
        <p>They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.</p>

        <p>
          Urban (gentrified) bears have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other urban creatures if
          necessary, but prefer to scavenge from dumpsters and fast food joints.
        </p>

        <p>
          When food has proven scarce, urban bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal
          essentials like baked beans, ready meals, and microwave ovens.
        </p>

        <p>Urban bears will sleep anywhere from bus shelters to their own apartments.</p>

        <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
        <p>
          Bears are romantic creatures. Wild bears may decorate their caves, while urban bears prefer mood lighting
          and a Michael Bublé CD.
        </p>
